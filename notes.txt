libuv library allwos node to comunicate with computer internals

Node creates labels from javascript code, ie functions and variables, all stored in Global Memory

nodejs functions do 2 main things:
1. run code2. accept input parameters

javascript node fs.createReadStream creates a c++ readStream to read from the given file system file accessing the computer internals witht eh c++ features

fs: read from ./file.json

@64kb -> (shout out the 'data' event)

you can pass a first object arguemtn to create readStream that decides the watermerk (default is 64000kb)

readStream.on('eventtype', functionCalledOnNewBatch)

the stream only grabs ddata once we call on and pass something for a 'data' event


After each bucket, the data processed will be returned

the callback queue is used to hold batches waiting on doOnNewBatch


asynchorincity:

if something i on the calls tack then the current data gets put into the timer queue
